## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript

### What I learned

I got to learn more about grids and javascript. As this is my first javascript project so this challenge help me get to know how interactivity is important for a website.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
span.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  span.classList.toggle("active");
  currActive = span.innerText;
});
```

### Continued development

I would continue on with my journey on the javascript and will carry on with similar projects for better understanding;

### Useful resources

- [Javascript info](https://javascript.info) - This helped me to get down with the basics of javascript.
- [The net ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) - This is an amazing youtube channel which helped me understand javascript. I'd recommend it to anyone new learning this language.
